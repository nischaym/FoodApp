Hi,

Thanks for the challenge,
Here are the few things i did apart from the 4 steps which were required by default.

Menu
1. This is a lookup menu created by the user/chef, he can do all the CRUD operations required 
	-- To add a new item just type the name of the food and the price in $, The price
		should be a number and the fields cannot be empty and click on the plus mark.
	-- To Delete a existing menu, click on the cross markin the Menu table
	-- To update the existing Menu item , click on the pencil mark, this will put the item
			on the  editing box and now the item can be updated as required and the click on
			tick mark

2. The Current order table shows the current order, only the items existing in the Menu can be
	added else the system will throw an error, the cost the item need not be enter as this will be	
		taken from the menu table.
		
3. Once the current order is done, the chef can click on the check box to delete it.

4. once the item is removed from the the current order table, the item is updated in the order history
	table. you can view this in two tables.
	-- first tables shows the table in time sorted order.
	-- in second table you can view the consolidated data of all the orders already served
	Data will not be pushed into this view until the chef deletes the order in his current orders.
	
5. you can sort the items based on name, price, count and total earning from that item etc.
